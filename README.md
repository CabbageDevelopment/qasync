## Introduction

`qasync` allows coroutines to be used in PyQt/PySide applications by providing an implementation of the `PEP 3156` event-loop. 

`qasync` is a fork of [asyncqt](https://github.com/gmarull/asyncqt), which is a fork of [quamash](https://github.com/harvimt/quamash). May it live longer than its predecessors. 

#### The future of `qasync`

`qasync` was created because `asyncqt` and `quamash` are no longer maintained.

**`qasync` will continue to be maintained, and will still be accepting pull requests.**

## Requirements

`qasync` requires Python >= 3.6, and PyQt5 or PySide2.

## Installation

To install `qasync`, use `pip`:

```
pip install qasync
```
